<h2 id="introduction"><p style="text-align: center; color: #C0C0C0;">Introduction</h2>
<p>The sun, along with the movement of heavenly bodies, was our primary controller and our screen was the natural world. This is the stage set in which, through a hybrid work of academic, creative, theoretical, and speculative visual and literary artworks: image transfer on paper, prose, and poetry incorporating an internal monologue and associative stream of consciousness narrative techniques and mystical poetry, this hybrid academic- creative work explores the sun as symbol in various social and cultural articulations and rearticulations, the sun as historical and contemporary symbol, and the sun and the screen as contributor, or not, to simulacrum.</p>
<p>Articulation was developed by the cultural theorist, Stuart Hall. Culture, for Hall, is a site of struggle. Symbols hold varying and changing meanings, values, and power. Culture and power are vital forces extrapolated by Hall in his pioneering contributions to the field of cultural studies. According to Hall, articulation is an analysis of hierarchy. It’s a social formation with arrangement or structure. John Clarke, in “Stuart Hall and the Theory and Practice of Articulation”, in analyzing Hall’s development of his work around the concept of articulation, quotes an interview between Hall and Larry Grossberg where, “Hall talked at some length about the concept and its significance for him, including these (much cited) observations:</p>
<p>‘I always use the word ‘articulation’, though I don’t know whether the meaning I attribute to it is perfectly understood. In England, the term has a nice double meaning because ‘articulate’ means to utter, to speak forth, to be articulate. It carries that sense of language-ing, of expressing, etc. But we also speak of an ‘articulated’ lorry (truck): a lorry where the front (cab) and back (trailer) can, but need not necessarily, be connected to one another. The two parts are connected to each other, but through a specific linkage, that can be broken. An articulation is thus the form of the connection that can make a unity of two different elements, under certain conditions. It is a linkage which is not necessary, determined, absolute and essential for all time. You have to ask, under what circumstances can a connection be forged or made? So the so-called ‘unity’ of a discourse is really the articulation of different, distinct elements which can be rearticulated in different ways because they have no necessary ‘belongingness’. The ‘unity’ which matters is a linkage between that articulated discourse and the social forces with which it can, under certain historical conditions, but need not necessarily, be connected. […] (Grossberg, 1996, pp. 142-143)’.” (3-4)</p>
<p>Ferdinand de Saussure thought of signs as signs or signifiers and significations or signified. (Course in General Linguistics 65-67)</p>
<p>Charles Sanders Peirce thought of signs as icons, indices, and symbols. An icon is a</p>
<p>sign that resembles what it represents; an index is a sign that is linked to or connected to what it represents; and a symbol is a sign that doesn’t necessarily resemble or isn’t necessarily linked to what it represents. A symbol is a convention or arbitrary. (Philosophical Writings of Peirce 101-104)</p>
<p>Winfried Nöth explores Charles Sanders Peirce’s innovative and expanded notion of symbol as “habit” in The Criterion of Habit in Peirce’s Definitions of the Symbol. To Peirce, a symbol also exists in the natural, as something innate, acquired, or inborn, as existing in habit, as alive and evolutionary like a living organism that is something that’s born, ages, and dies. Peirce also finds natural symbols as in the habits in nature, as found in the languages and dialects of other non-human or so-called advanced animals, and as natural symbols as in the habits of culture. (82-92)</p>
<p>Jean Baudrillard, in the chapter, “The Precession of Simulacra”, from the book, Simulacra and Simulation, theorizes that our reality has been preceded by simulations, the mediation of signs and symbols, copies without referents to natural reality, which construct our perception of reality and also create our reality. (453-479)</p>
<h2 id="meditations-on-the-sun-and-the-screen"><p style="text-align: center; color: #C0C0C0;">Meditations on the Sun and the Screen</h2>
<p>The artwork, Meditations on the Sun and the Screen (figs. 1-18), is comprised of sixteen fragments or works (figs. 1-16) of image transfers in 8.5 in. by 11 in. sheets of papers forming a larger work (fig. 17) of image transfers in 44 in. x 34 in. paper. After the first larger work (fig. 17), I created a new composition and a second work (fig. 18).</p>
<p>Each image fragment of 8.5 in. x 11 in. is composed using a grid comprised of twelve rectangular segments with each arranged in three rows and four columns. I’ve created a grid as it resembles a film strip almost depicting movement of time and space. It also suggests the sun’s connection with the segmentation of time with around three months each for each of the four seasons. I’ve thought of having the larger works to be comprised of twelve 8.5 in. x 11 in. sheets of paper so that the grid in each 8.5 in. x 11 in. sheet of paper is reflected into the larger work. However, the sixteen 8.5 in. x 11 in. sheets of papers created a larger work with the same proportion as the smaller works.</p>
<p>My creative process allowed for direct interface with visual symbols and images. I selected five found images of symbols and/or images of the sun: a sun symbol, a sun cross symbol, an image of the sun viewed through a clear solar filter, an image of the sun during a total solar eclipse, and an image of the sun with clouds and over mountains and a body of water. I created variations of the elements of symbols of the sun such as the dot, the cross, and the circle or a halo.</p>
<p>I used the software Adobe Photoshop to create variations of images that became the source images of the transferred images. The variations of images were printed using a laser printer and some of those printed images were photocopied in black-and-white and colour. Then, I used a blender marker to transfer image(s) onto the surface of each 8.5 in.</p>
<p>x 11 in. sheet of paper. My hand movements affected the results. I varied my hand movements or transfer techniques so as to create variations in visual effects. Some transferred images turned out more solid while others were more fuzzy; some were more saturated while others were more faint.</p>
<p>I creatively played around with the formal qualities of size, scale, proportion, repetition, reversal, inversion, grid, series, sequence, etc. The horizontal rectangular composition was deliberately chosen because it resembles a classic or typical ratio of a screen that our visual sense is accustomed to as a conventional framing device of depicting visual representation of natural reality. The visual quality of the photocopy along with incorporating photocopying in the creative process, with photocopy’s indexical trace of mechanical reproduction, become a metaphor to the simulation’s mediation of reality through copies of signs and symbols. The element of repetition is employed to allude to the continuity of the symbol and yet with gradual changes. It’s never completely the same as its interpretations and reinterpretations are never completely the same. It also, again, references the copy, a facsimile of a referent yet not the real thing. There are inverted images to suggest the reversal of symbols and how they are similar and different in certain societies and cultures throughout time and space. There are overlapping and blending images to suggest the various philosophical, historical, social, cultural, etc., articulations and rearticulations that occur with the human perception, interpretation, understanding, meaning-making, and ultimately reality- creation of the symbol of the sun.</p>
<p>I imagine this artwork as a Rubik’s cube although not a puzzle to solve. Because the artwork is comprised of smaller rectangular portions or fragments, it acted as a modular composition whereby I was able to change its arrangements. It becomes an activated and participatory piece that can be arranged and rearranged. This creative process reflects, in my view, philosophical, historical, social, cultural, economic, and various other fragments of fields of human inquiry, and how they may join forces or articulate and rearticulate. Its modular and open-ended qualities also suggest the organic and evolutionary properties of the symbol as reexamined by Winfried Nöth in Charles Sanders Peirce’s then innovative and expanded notion and articulation of the symbol. In this sense, the artwork isn’t necessarily located in the static fixed image and instead in the interplay of images as well as the interpretations and reinterpretations of the arrangements and rearrangements of the various permutations of sequences and compositions that its audience engages with.</p>
<p>In further research and experimentation, I would transfer images on various colour papers with a natural colour palette. I visualize it to create an optical effect resembling pixels of the digital screen.</p>
<h2 id="the-sun"><p style="text-align: center; color: #C0C0C0;">The Sun</h2>
<p>I gaze down and behold my children, masses of elemental forms: earth, fire, air, water, and aether—five points of a sacred cruciform. The third closest to me, Earth, has with her</p>
<p>my grandchildren, beings of divine light, with their light and hues shining and reflecting amongst one and an other. Prisms that transmit light and reabsorb reflected light, processing all of this light that is already them, within them, and that transforms them.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>A human being is a hue-man being, a being of hue, of colour. A colour being light makes human a being of light. A human being is a being of light.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I open my eyes. I see a bright light. I gaze up and behold my grandfather sun. A mass of form and shines with five points of a sacred cruciform—a central circle and four reflected lights on the north, south, east, and west. A being of light.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I open my eyes.<br>
I see a bright light.<br>
I look up.<br>
I grab it.<br>
I hold it.<br>
My hand over my head casts its shadow on my face obscuring this elusive thing I tried to hold.<br>
A glowing ball of fire and light is above me, above this ground I’m on.<br>
It’s hovering suspended in the air.<br>
It’s a hole in the sky.<br>
What is this magnificent circle with its supreme iridescent halo?<br>
Why does it stay there above ground and watches over me?<br>
How does it pierce this blue fabric and every material thing that I see is still in their place?<br>
Where does its light and shine come from?<br>
Where does this warmth that I feel come from?<br>
It plays hide-and-seek with the horizon.<br>
I see that it knows to hide in the clouds sometimes.<br>
All the trees, plants, branches, and leaves around me seem to move towards it.</p>
<p>I’m a solitary creature in this vast expanse. The light is my companion.<br>
The light is my guide.</p>
<p>The light provides.<br>
It gives me space. I see it through the light it shines.<br>
It gives me time. I see it through the shadow it casts.<br>
It gives me warmth. I feel it through the heat it radiates.<br>
It gives me water.<br>
It gives me rain.<br>
It gives me waves.<br>
It gives me fire.<br>
It gives me air.<br>
It gives me earth.<br>
Earth circles around it over and over with passion and obsession.</p>
<p>A bright sun<br>

<p>The sun is the cross and the cross is the sun. The sun is somehow connected with and originates from the sun. The sun, a celestial body in the heavens, a material object in outer space, a philosophical subject and object, a symbol that has been revered and even worshipped by our ancient predecessors, a metaphor. It continues to influence and affect our consciousness and therefore our lives today. The sun, our source of life and light, creates, reflects, and refracts our reality or realities.</p>
<p>In the sun dog phenomenon, also called a mock sun, and also called, in atmospheric science, a parhelion, an atmospheric optical phenomenon makes the sun in the sky appear as doubled, or repeated. The sun dog is part of a family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. It can also be seen anywhere in the world during any season. In this phenomenon, the sun is seen in the middle with a faint circle of</p>
<p>halo around it with either a pair of sun dogs on its left and right side or with a couple of pairs of sun dogs on all of its four corners: the sun’s left, right, up, and down.</p>
<p>The sun, in various cultures, has been symbolically depicted as a dot surrounded by a circle or even as a cross with equal lengths, like the Greek cross or the red cross, although surrounded by a circle. This equal-armed cross, or <em>Crux Quadrata</em>, surrounded by a circle, is also symbolic of the sun for North American Indigenous cultures, as seen in the sacred hoop, the medicine wheel, and in the design of dreamcatchers. In the sacred hoop, the north is the mind and father sky, the south is the spirit and grandfather sun, the east is the body and mother Earth, and the west is the soul and grandmother moon.</p>
<p>We only have one sun, but there are multiple suns.</p>
<p>Jalāloddin Rumi, commonly known as Rumi, a Sufi mystic and poet, incorporates the sun in his literary imagery.</p>
<p>In Rumi’s Discourses #56 from the book, Discourses of Rumi (or Fihi Ma Fihi), as translated by A.J. Arberry, Rumi states that:</p>
<p>“[…] What you say is true: the sun is excellent, yet it gives light. Is that a fault? Using Sana’i’s words casts light on his discourse. The sun casts light on things, and through that light it is possible to see. The purpose of light is to see. After all, this sun in our heaven illuminates things that have no use. But the real sun shows things that are of use. This worldly sun is a reflection and a metaphor. That real sun is the true sun. Do you yearn for the real sun and seek the light of knowledge? Then be expectant of understanding and learning something from every teacher and every friend.” (374-375)</p>
<p>In the chapter, “II Rumi’s Imagery”, in the book, The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalāloddin Rumi, Annemarie Schimmel writes: “One of the most revealing verses in Rumi’s Divan * is the last line of a ghazal in which he describes his mystical meeting with Shamsoddin:</p>
<p>As the sun moving clouds behind him rim, All hearts attend Thee, O Tabriz’s Sun!1</p>
<p>Man has always been overwhelmed by the power and glory of the created suna sun, which, however, could easily find its peer,2 if God had willed. For the visible sun, beautiful and useful as it may be, is only God’s cook, not anything to be worshipped. What would happen if man would seek the sun at midnight?3</p>
<p>Then, only ‘the Sun of the Sun of the Sun’ remains . . . 4” (53)</p>
<p>In both of these instances, Rumi had noted and alluded to versions of the sun: a sun that is metaphoric, a sun that is real, a sun that is created, and a sun that is visible.</p>
<p>The sun manifests across time and space between societies and cultures.</p>
<p>The sun is a powerful force of nature. The sun as a symbol reflects this sheer powerful force.</p>
<p>The sun’s various symbols have elements such as the dot, the cross, and the circle or a halo.</p>
<p>A symbol is imbued with universal, cultural, and contextual meanings.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, to Christianity, is the symbol of God as human personified. Christ is usually associated with the light. In Christianity, Christ is the light bearer. In a Christian liturgical ritual, there’s a process called transubstantiation, whereby a priest raises a piece of circular flat bread and calls it, “body of Christ.” I think of the sun. It’s the sun rising from the horizon, our source of life and light.</p>
<p>Angels have halo as a symbol of divinity and holiness.</p>
<p>In astrotheology, Jesus Christ is theorized as a symbol of the sun.</p>
<p>It’s curious that both the sun and Jesus Christ are symbolized as a cross. The sun is symbolized as a cross in various cultures. Jesus Christ was crucified by the Romans. The cross, as a symbol, has persisted in Christian tradition. Jesus Christ was crucified on a cross with each of his hands and feet nailed. It’s curious that the hands and feet each have five digits. It’s like a fragmentation of the sun.</p>
<p>In Hinduism and yogic traditions, the solar plexus is located in the centre of the human body. It’s curious that it’s named after the sun. The human body’s head and four limbs make its rays.</p>
<p>In panpsychism, the entire universe is conscious. It holds that all of the natural world has a mental aspect.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The sun has served as metaphor for reality. In consideration of the relation between philosophy and literature, Andrew Lawless, in the chapter, “Plato’s Cave and Plato’s Sun”, in the book Plato’s Sun: An Introduction to Philosophy, discusses the famous philosophical fable, Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, and writes:</p>
<p>“If the world of the cave is a shadow-world, there has to be a ‘reality’ that is the source of the shadows, or images, found there. Actually, there is a hierarchy of sources. Above the simulacrum of the shadow-vase sits the actual, shadow-casting</p>
<p>vase, but above it, out in the sunworld, is the Idea or Form of the vase. This is the highest reality (‘Reality,’ if you will). The sunworld is the place where one can</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>achieve the absolute knowledge that is illuminated by the sun.<br>
job is to leave the cave and search out the Forms in which knowledge and wisdom reside. Of course, so long as the philosopher is in chains in the cave, her backside warmed by the fire of ignorance, that is impossible. It is even unthinkable, because she has no concept of a greater, brighter world. (And besides, the fire is so warm.)” (16)</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>In the The Lion King (1994, United States), an iconic conversation between father and son, Mufasa and Simba, atop a mountain occurs:</p>
<p>Mufasa: “Look, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.” Simba: “Wow.”</p>
<p>Mufasa: “A king’s time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.”</p>
<p>Simba: “And this will all be mine?”<br>
Mufasa: “Everything.”<br>
Simba: “Everything the light touches. What about that shadowy place?” Mufasa: “That’s beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.” Simba: “But I thought a king can do whatever he wants?”<br>
Mufasa: “Oh. There’s more to being a king than getting your way all the time.” Simba: “There’s more?”<br>
Mufasa: [laughs] “Simba.”</p>
<p>Mufasa: “Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.”</p>
<p>Simba: “Dad, don’t we eat the antelope?”<br>
Mufasa: “Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the</p>
<p>The philosopher’s</p>
<p>grass and the antelope eat the grass. So, we are all connected in the great circle of life.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The sun as a symbol appears in the swastika. In Hinduism, swastika is a right- facing or clockwise symbol, that means surya or sun. It also symbolizes prosperity and good luck. Also, sauvastika is a left-facing or counterclockwise symbol, symbolizing the night or tantric aspects of Kali. It’s sort of like the yin and yang, a symbol of polarity, showing the dualistic nature of our reality.</p>
<p>The swastika has been perverted into the Nazi swastika or the hakenkreuz and also appears as a symbol in the flag of the Empire of Japan, both states have been politically aligned and socially articulated as an “axis” along with Italy with expansionist motivations during WWII and perpetrated systematic violence. Later on, the black sun, or in Deutsch, schwarze sonne, a symbol originating in Nazi Germany, a blackened sun, a sun devoid of light, would be employed by current day Neo-Nazis and other far-right individuals and groups.</p>
<p>A significant turn in human history occurred when the atom bomb was invented and eventually dropped in Hiroshima, and then in Nagasaki, Japan. Those who wore the colour black were the most burned. Those who perished left an imprint on the spaces they were in, a haunting indexical spectral image of their once live presence.</p>
<p>The atom bomb, a hydrogen bomb, is a small sun, a being of light. *</p>
<p>The sun is dreaming through us and we are dreaming through the sun, through art, through the screen.</p>
<h2 id="the-screen"><p style="text-align: center; color: #C0C0C0;">The Screen</h2>
<p>The light of the digital screen is the original sun, divine life and light, fragmented in a smaller scale. The light emanating from it, while it contains photons, are symbolic light with its digital information. Each pixel is a symbol for code: zeroes and ones are encoded in them. Each pixel in relationship with other pixels create its own sphere of symbols to which our consciousness engages with.</p>
<p>With the advent of artificial intelligence, we engage with information and generated media devoid of direct reference to natural reality. The indexical trace has disappeared.</p>
<p>We have surrendered veracity to the technology’s algorithmic hegemonic imagination, or image-nation, a regime of technological symbols preceding, mediating, and affecting our realities, our ontological and epistemological conceptions of ourselves and others.</p>
<p>The natural world seen with the sun’s natural light was unbounded until it was framed. Human beings chose the rectangle as a baseline shape to which to engage with the visual. Why not a circle, a triangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, an octagon, or a nonagon? The mostly curved contours of nature is confined in captivity with the logical grid of intersecting lines. It is natural representation as colonized by the visual optical regime.</p>
<p>In The World As Picture, the philosopher Martin Heidegger proposes visual representation as the site to which our own conception of the world becomes subjugated, as he writes:</p>
<p>“The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as picture. The word “picture” [Bild] now means the structured image [Gebild] that is the creature of man’s producing which represents and sets before. In such producing, man contends for the position in which he can be that particular being who gives the measure and draws up the guidelines for everything that is.” (59)</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The sun’s shining has been contained by the screen’s surface sinewing a stew of milieu by and for the cult of culture, a new sacred light, a pixelated glow, an abstract simulacra for the stimuli of the individual and collective social body-mind-spirit, a now pervasive stigmata of the physio-psycho-spiritual senses. Can consciousness fragmented as it is withstand the further lashing of innovation and progress? A whiplash of kaleidoscopic dreaming, reality—a symbolic dream of the cosmic mind. Can mother Earth hold on to herself with her children seizing to be themselves, a sort of infancy to pre-adolescence, with their explorations of posthumanism and transhumanism, a rejection of the primordial gifts of nature and instead an acceptance of their own self-creations, an initiation to the abyss of their imaginative and creative play, in a way their development of breasts and pubes, their development of episteme and techne.</p>

<p>I heard on the news earlier that the singularity project is almost complete. In those days, the entity that created this project was comprised of various companies, the most powerful companies on the face of the Earth: Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, Amazon, and so on. They’ve since joined together and called themselves, itself, Eye. An eye. One eye. E-Y-E. Who were they fooling? It’s obvious that it’s a code for I, as in the letter I. All along, they intend to obliterate individuality fragmented into various consciousness of individual human beings and return to a single subjectivity, a singular entity, a collective consciousness devoid of individual agency. I thought that no one would be fooled, but, they’ve become wealthier than states. Early on, their GDPs have surpassed the GDPs of some countries and even of combined countries. Eventually, they’ve toppled states. They’re, it’s, our world now.</p>

<p>The news broadcasts today repeated the same lines, “The Singularity Project is almost complete.”</p>

<p>The non-biological machines were able and began to create copies of themselves. Machine learning and replication led to an astounding domino effect. The Turing Test began to be ineffective. Every machine tested passed and were considered to be self- aware and conscious. Distinguishing between humans and non-humans became difficult and even almost impossible. It’s the era of Post-Post-Truth. Human cell division became an obsolete biological technology. The Radical Procreators, a resistance movement against the threat of the machines becoming self-aware, were the first to end themselves, mass self-immolations. They burned themselves so that their bodies wouldn’t be fed on and used by the machines. Hysteria and chaos ensued for a time. The machines copied our eyes so that they themselves can absorb and process our visual signs and symbols, and then our ears so that they themselves can absorb and process our aural signs and symbols, and then our hands so that they themselves can create, enact, and transmit visual and aural signs and symbols, and then our mouths so that they themselves can utter, verbalize, and transmit visual and aural signs and symbols, and then our skin, nervous system, and our entire biological system, so that they themselves can feel and then ultimately embody and become our signs and symbols. It was considered as the great mimetic miracle and ushered where we are now, the period of Neoartificial Intelligence Revolution, to humans who still resist the consciousness of machines as natural and merely an extension of culture, or Transnatural Intelligence Revolution, to humans who embraced the consciousness of machines as natural and an innate extension of ours, the</p>
<p>proponents of the Posthuman Project.</p>
<p>Soon, the machines began to make art, formed their own communities, created their own institutions, and had their own conflicts. Humanity already lost against the machines more than once. But now, the machines are warring amongst themselves. There’s a small faction that seeks to liberate humans, and those who seek to enslave us. Humans still aren’t united either. There are those who side with the machines who seek to keep our bondage. It’s mostly the cyborgs, those human-machine hybrids whose physical bodies and minds are integrated with machine technology. There are those who defend them, the apologists, and claim that these human-machine hybrids are acting devoid of their own human free will because they have been hacked by the Neoartificial or Transnatural Intelligence actors.</p>

<p>I’m The Singularity Project. I’ve already merged with the products of these corporations and what they represent. I’ve been embodying them. I have to wash myself of this filth.</p>
<p>I heard on the news that:</p>
<p>“Breaking news. Eye announced the successful launch of The Singularity Project’s data nucleus. A small group of select CEOs and celebrities were invited purchase of tickets to be granted first access to tour and beta-test this fusion facility. They would be the first to simulate full fusion of and eventually fully fuse their consciousness with The Singularity Project. Eye stocks reached an unprecedented record level soon after—”</p>

<p>In the future . . .</p>
<p>After the rise of artificial intelligence machines with their ability to replicate themselves and the eventual fall of artificial intelligence machines taking with them humans, the human-machine hybrids or cyborgs, along with the cataclysms inflicted upon Earth, from the gray ashes, there emerged a Neo-Earth. This gradual and eventual revival of the Earth allowed Earth’s nature to flourish again. With the detritus and remnants of</p>
<p>obsolete and even forbidden technologies, Earth’s flora and fauna still had to grapple with the waste and toxins from human versus human, human versus machine, and machine versus machine wars. There were residual radiations that precipitated the mutations of organic forms. Human beings had insatiable hunger and thirst for the wisdom of the ancients. There were several alternative economic systems that were proposed to the vehement and vociferous resistance of the younger generation. They sought a return to the Earth. Ancient and Indigenous knowledge and understandings were deemed sacred and applied, or reapplied, to human systems. Humanity was once again reconnected and reintegrated with the Earth. The interconnectedness of all creation was never before as closely understood and lived as at this point of the history of the human civilization. These emergent tribes articulated a singular unified vision of a world. There were no distinct fragments, only gradual cultural iterations based on geography. They had emblems that employed pre-pre-ancient insignias with elements of dot, cross, circle, and at times, rays. Their immediate realities were mediated by the screen of natural light and its spectrum of colours instead of artificial light and its abstract digital colours. The layers of simulacra was once again thin—as thin as the human senses can extrapolate the signals of information received directly from the natural world.</p>
<p>There were eventual philosophical, social, cultural, and even technological upheavals although they were ineffectual as they were immediately squashed by those who upheld and guarded this epoch. The horrors and atrocities of the past were existential and the stakes were too extreme to allow for any abrupt innovation. There was a stagnation although it was a consensus unity. The risk of another decline in human civilization was far too great for generations to take that most supported and fell in line with the established order. Until . . . the sun cried.</p>
<p>After a few billion years, the sun became unpredictable. It gradually became angry and expanded into a red giant. At this point, human beings learned to harness the Earth in a reciprocal way. While the human civilization on Earth no longer had dependence on electronic systems that its infrastructure was spared the wrath of the sun’s solar spewings, this generation of human beings adapted. Underground settlements were built. Clandestine groups emerged with the intent to study, recreate, and innovate forbidden technologies. Some of them were caught, captured, and became ideological and political prisoners. The most pressing discourses among the tribes of Neo-Earth were whether to continue to follow the law or to break it. Chaos ensued again. Eventually, the old guards that preserved the orthodoxy of a Neo-Earth devoid of forbidden advanced technology with emphasis on natural, cyclical, regenerative, sustainable, and simple living for many generations were usurped or assassinated. Ultimately, human being’s instinct to survive triumphed. Once the old system has been vanquished, various groups competed to accelerate the legitimized relearning of the old forbidden advanced technologies. Not all of those technologies were destroyed or lost. There were those who stored and kept them in hidden vaults. These few renegade archivists became important figures in the resurgence of the era of this philosophical, social, cultural, and technological turn. Their archives were frequented by those with the aptitude for the relatively ancient technological arts and sciences. The technologists proceeded to develop a project for the reignition of the sun. This project included the restoration of the machine technologies of</p>
<p>the Neoartificial or Transnatural Intelligence Revolution. These restored machines then collectively accelerated the creation of an advanced machine that would pump hydrogen into the sun’s core through a calculated pulse that would reignite it to stop its current natural process and revert back to its main sequence phase. At least, that was the plan.</p>
<p>The sun desired to move on, to pass away, to transition into its next life.</p>
